    "## OCR Code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this code:\n",
    "* Ensure that your computer is using a python environment with all of the packages shown in the import cell below\n",
    "* Create lineup.csv and a sightings.csv files following the format of the example files in this repository\n",
    "* Populate lineuppath, sightingpath, videopath, and writepath according to your computer's filesystem\n",
    "* Run all of the cells EXCEPT the one specifying lineuppath, sightingpath, etc.\n",
    "* Run the cell containing lineuppath, sightingpath, etc to begin <b>ocr_complete</b>, and wait for it to finish - depending on the number of sightings and videos provided, this process may take several minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the size of a specimen on camera, the distance between the camera and that specimen must be known. When recording with the Splash Drone 2, proprietary flight log formats prevented us from extracting altitude data directly from the drone. As a workaround we developed an OCR function to read altitude information from a video stream produced by the Splash Drone 2 that displayed during flight on the drone's transmitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code requires:\n",
    " * An HD video stream from the drone\n",
    " * An SD video stream originally displayed on the drone's transmitter screen and saved on an external computer. This is the stream that contains flight information such as altitude, battery info, etc.\n",
    " * Two separate csv files, one noting the clips of the hd video being examined (in our case, any point where a whale appears on screen), and the other noting the lineup point between the HD and SD videos (e.g. HD video 01's recording at X second corresponds to SD video's recording at Y seconds).\n",
    " \n",
    "Format examples for the .csv files are included in this repository."
